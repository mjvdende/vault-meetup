# Vault
Vault is a tool for **securely** accessing secrets. A **secret** is anything that
you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more.
Vault provides a **unified interface** to any secret, while providing **tight access control**
and recording a detailed **audit log**.

!SUB
# Without Vault
- More and more secrets
- Secrets all over the place
- No insight who uses which secret
- No procedure in case something bad happens

!SUB
# With Vault
- Centralized source for secrets
- Unified access interface
- Pluggable backends

# Backends

!SUB
# Storage Backend
A storage backend is responsible for durable storage of encrypted data. Backends
are not trusted by Vault and are only expected to provide durability. The storage
backend is configured when starting the Vault server.

!SUB
# Secret Backend
A secret backend is responsible for managing secrets. Simple secret backends like
the "generic" backend simply return the same secret when queried. Some backends
support using policies to dynamically generate a secret each time they are queried.

!SUB
# Auth Backend
Auth backends are the components in Vault that perform authentication and are
responsible for assigning identity and a set of policies to a user.

!SUB
# Audit Backend
Audit backends are the components in Vault that keep a detailed log of all requests
and response to Vault.

# The Setup
Download the appropriate Vault binary for your platform and add it to your PATH
so that it can be accessed from anywhere:
<br/>
<br/>

</center>

!SUB
# Start Vault server
We're going to start the Vault server in dev mode. The dev server is a built-in
flag to start a pre-configured server that is not very secure but useful for playing
with Vault locally.
```
$ vault server -dev
==> WARNING: Dev mode is enabled!
...
```
With the dev server running, do the following three things:

1. Copy the export VAULT_ADDR=... command from your terminal output and run it
in a **different** terminal window. This will configure the Vault client to talk to the dev server.
2. Save the root-token somewhere.

!SUB
# Check the Vault server
Verify the server is running by running ```vault status```.  If it ran successfully,
the output should look like below:

```
$ vault status
Sealed: false
Key Shares: 1
Key Threshold: 1
Unseal Progress: 0

High-Availability Enabled: false
```
If you see an error about opening a connection, make sure you copied and executed
the export VAULT_ADDR=... command from above properly.

!SLIDE
<!-- .slide: data-background="#6C1D5F" -->
# Secrets

!SUB
# Writing secrets

```
$ vault write secret/hello value=world foo=bar
```
This writes the pairs *value=world* and *foo=bar* to the path secret/hello. The secret/
prefix is where arbitrary secrets can be read and written.

```
$ echo -n '{"value":"itsasecret"}' | vault write secret/password -
$ echo -n "itsasecret" | vault write secret/password value=-
```
This first command writes the pair *value=itsasecret* the path secret/password
via a full JSON object. The second command writes to the same path but it specifies
the key via the command and the JSON value through stdin.

!SUB
# Reading secrets
Data can be read using vault read. This command is very simple:

```
$ vault read secret/password
Key             Value
lease_id        secret/password/76c844fb-aeba-a766-0a50-2b907072233a
lease_duration  2592000
value           itsasecret
```
You can use the -format flag to get various different formats out from the command.
Some formats are easier to use in different environments than others.

You can also use the -field flag to extract an individual field from the secret data.

```
$ vault read -field=value secret/password
itsasecret
```

!SUB
# Deleting secrets

Now that we've learned how to read and write a secret, let's go ahead and delete
it. We can do this with vault delete:

```
$ vault delete secret/password
Success! Deleted 'secret/password'
```

# Authentication

!SUB
# Token Authentication

Token authentication allows users to authenticate using a token, as well to create
new tokens, revoke secrets by token, and more.

When you start a dev server with **vault server -dev**, it outputs your root token.
The root token is the initial access token to configure Vault. It has root
privileges, so it can perform any operation within Vault.

doc: [auth/token](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/token.html)

!SUB
Let's create a new token:
```
$ vault token-create
Key             Value
token           03ad6f52-495d-b7f4-165b-cd5ecbcc0853
token_accessor  56b3fda1-218a-46ab-e8e6-a6cd37452bd3
token_duration  0
token_renewable true
token_policies  [root]
```
Tokens have parent-child relationships. Since we used the root token to authenticate
with Vault, this new token is a child of that root token. By default, it also inherits
the permissions of the parent token, in this case the "root" policy which allows
all operations within Vault. Policies will be discussed in the next section.

!SUB
# Userpass Authentication
Token authentication is great but if you want to allow users to connect without
much effort then the "userpass" combination is a nice way. The "userpass" auth
backend allows users to authenticate with Vault using a username and password combination.

To use it we need to enable it
```
$ vault auth-enable userpass
Successfully enabled 'userpass' at 'userpass'!
```

doc: [auth/userpass](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/userpass.html)

!SUB
We can see which auth backends are enabled:
```
$ vault auth -methods
Path       Type      Description
token/     token     token based credentials
userpass/  userpass
```

Let's create a username & password to authenticate to Vault with the root policy
instead of using an token:
```
$ vault write auth/userpass/users/meetup password=1234 policies=root
Success! Data written to: auth/userpass/users/meetup
```

Now we can log in with that username and password:
```
$ vault auth -method=userpass username=meetup password=1234
Successfully authenticated!
token: a6e9151d-da97-a3c9-172c-ec3e62aa2d96
token_duration: 0
token_policies: [root]
```

doc: [auth](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/index.html)

# Authorization

!SUB
# Policies
Please read the (relatively short) [policy documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies.html)
in order to fully understand Vault policies and succesfully complete the upcoming exercises.

!SUB
Let's create and activate a policy in Vault. Copy the following example policy to
a file called **policy.hcl**:
```
path "secret/*" {
  policy = "write"
}

path "secret/foo" {
  policy = "read"
}
```
This policy allows storage of new secrets under any path in the secrets backend,
except for the "secret/foo" path.

Store the policy in Vault with:
```
$ vault policy-write secret policy.hcl
Policy 'secret' written.
```

!SUB
Create a new token with policy we just created:
```
$ vault token-create -policy="secret"
Key             Value
token           $TOKEN
token_accessor  71770cc5-14da-f0af-c6ce-17a0ae398d67
token_duration  2592000
token_renewable true
token_policies  [default secret]
```
Notice the $TOKEN in the output which will be generated dynamically by Vault.

**Before executing the next step please store your root token somewhere safe so that you can find it again later.**

Now authenticate with the new token:
```
$ vault auth $TOKEN
Successfully authenticated!
```

!SUB
If the policy was succesfully applied we should be able to run the following command:
```
$ vault write secret/bar value=foobar
Success! Data written to: secret/bar
```
However, the following command should be blocked by our policy:
```
$ vault write secret/foo value=bar
Error writing data to secret/foo: Error making API request.

URL: PUT http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/foo
Code: 400. Errors:

* permission denied
```

Authenticate again with the root token that you stored previously.

**tip**: try to create at least one new policy to really familiarize yourself
with the policies in Vault.

# Dynamic Secrets

!SUB
# PostgreSQL Secret backend
The PostgreSQL backend is __dynamic__, meaning secrets are generated when they are accessed.
Vault will connect to PostgreSQL and create an user that will expire.

To use the PostgreSQL secret backend we need to mount it:
```
$ vault mount postgresql
Successfully mounted 'postgresql' at 'postgresql'!
```

Also, let's launch a PostgreSQL server in the background:
```
$ docker run --name vault-meetup-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pwd \
 -p "5432:5432" -d postgres
```
This requires Docker to be installed. Please see the [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) 
or ask one the workshop trainers to help you in case of problems.

!SUB

Let's specify a connecting string so that Vault can connect to PostgresSQL. The
$IP variable in the connection string is the location of your Docker host (in case
you are running on Windows or OSX).

```
$ vault write postgresql/config/connection \
    connection_url="postgresql://postgres:pwd@$IP:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
Success! Data written to: postgresql/config/connection
```

Next, we need to tell Vault how to create a new user in the PostgreSQL database.
We do this by specifying an SQL statement that Vault uses when generating new credentials.
```
$ vault write postgresql/roles/readonly \
    sql="CREATE ROLE \"{{name}}\" WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '{{password}}' VALID UNTIL '{{expiration}}';
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO \"{{name}}\";"
Success! Data written to: postgresql/roles/readonly
```
Note: more complex GRANT queries can be used to further customize privileges of the role

!SUB

Let's request some PostgreSQL credentials.

```
$ vault read postgresql/creds/readonly
Key            	Value
lease_id       	postgresql/creds/readonly/f2682645-f8cd-dd93-8f3f-427b97707ea4
lease_duration 	2592000
lease_renewable	true
password       	$PASSWORD
username       	$USER
```
The $USER and $PASSWORD will be generated dynamically by Vault. Lets try to connect
using an interactive container running `psql`:

```
$ docker run -it --rm --link vault-meetup-postgres:postgres postgres \
  psql -h postgres -U $USER -d postgres
```

Enter the $PASSWORD to fully authenticate with PostgreSQL. In psql try **\du**
to list the current users (exit the console with **\q**).

!SUB

Vault only deals with temporary credentials. With the PostgreSQL backend, you can configure the lease as follows with two configuration keys:

**lease**: Vault will automatically revoke the credential after the configured time has elapsed. This forces the client to renew their credentials regularly.

**lease_max**: This value is templated as "{{expiration}}" in the role configuration. It ensures that if Vault is unable to revoke the credential after the lease time, postgresql will always expire the credential on its own.

Set the lease to 1 minute, request a credential and see what happens when you login after a minute.

```
$ vault write postgresql/config/lease lease=1m lease_max=3m
```
 
doc: [secrets/postgresql](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/postgresql/index.html)

!SUB
# Transit secret backend
The transit secret backend is used to encrypt/decrypt data in-transit. Vault doesn't store the data sent to the backend. It can also be viewed as "encryption as a service."
The primary use case for the transit backend is to encrypt data from applications while still storing that encrypted data in some primary data store.

To use the transit secret backend we need to mount it
```
$ vault mount transit
Successfully mounted 'transit' at 'transit'!
```

doc: [secrets/transit](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/transit/index.html)

!SUB
After mounting the transit secret backend we need to create a "named encryption key" that can be referenced and used by other applications with independent keys.
```
$ vault write -f transit/keys/meetup
Success! Data written to: transit/keys/meetup
```

What have we created
```
$ vault read transit/keys/meetup
Key                     Value
cipher_mode             aes-gcm
deletion_allowed        false
derived                 false
keys                    map[1:1.463208292e+09]
latest_version          1
min_decryption_version  1
name                    meetup
```

!SUB
It's time to actually encrypt something, you can encrypt any data as long as it is base64 encoded. In our case let's encrypt a sentence.
```
$ echo -n "vault" | base64 | vault write transit/encrypt/meetup plaintext=-
Key         Value
ciphertext  $TEXT
```

Now let's see try to decrypt it
```
$ vault write transit/decrypt/meetup ciphertext=$TEXT
Key       Value
plaintext dmF1bHQ=

echo "dmF1bHQ=" | base64 -D
vault
```

!SUB
We can also rotate the key, meaning we can encrypt with a new key but we can decrypt with both keys
```
$ vault write -f transit/keys/meetup/rotate
Success! Data written to: transit/keys/meetup/rotate

echo -n "Hallo" | base64 | vault write transit/encrypt/meetup plaintext=-
Key         Value
ciphertext  vault:v2:7XTo4TQW+15zRMXA2NED2b8b7Tqrjhc2FVeAaSCbAISP

$ vault read transit/keys/meetup
Key                     Value
cipher_mode             aes-gcm
deletion_allowed        false
derived                 false
keys                    map[1:1.463208292e+09 2:1.463208919e+09]
latest_version          2
min_decryption_version  1
name                    meetup
```

It is also posible to update the encrypted data to the new key without ever seeing the decryted text
```
$ vault write transit/rewrap/meetup ciphertext=vault:v1:o20swhyIdj+DyEAMHQ+1EIlwwN/jKTy/TGA3zDAoXXWHMTxQHKDBZPtBdb7Tj0lLaun9gA==
Key         Value
ciphertext  vault:v2:ZruZRACkqXq+DrU0LF3u67s898l1qyqYiCXP2Sj41tMyjU4KUipQextfsDOc+kwIlq2fkg==
```  

!SUB
# Cubbyhole backend
The cubbyhole secret backend is used to store arbitrary secrets within the configured
physical storage for Vault.

This backend differs from the generic backend in that the generic backend's values
are accessible to **any token** with read privileges on that path. In cubbyhole, paths
are scoped **per token**; no token can access another token's cubbyhole, whether to
read, write, list, or for any other operation. When the token expires, its cubbyhole is destroyed.

doc: [secrets/cubbyhole](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/cubbyhole/index.html)

!SUB
One possible usage of the cubbyhole secret backend is passing a Vault token
securely to an application. The actual application token can be stored in the
cubbyhole backend and we can create a limited-use access token to reach the cubbyhole.
By limiting the amount of times the access token can be used we ensure that the
application token can only be retrieved once. After the application token is retrieved
the access token becomes invalid and the cubbyhole is destroyed.

Let's create a token with limited use:
```
$ vault token-create -use-limit=3


$ vault token-lookup 8dab6a3b-e8f3-c531-ed0d-34eda8398de5
Key           Value
......
num_uses      3
```

!SUB
Now that we have a token let's add something to cubbyhole and see what happens
```
$ vault auth 8dab6a3b-e8f3-c531-ed0d-34eda8398de5
Successfully authenticated!

$ vault write cubbyhole/my-app foo=bar
Success! Data written to: cubbyhole/my-app

$ vault read cubbyhole/my-app
Key           Value
foo           bar
```

Reading the value again
```
vault read cubbyhole/my-app
Error reading cubbyhole/my-app: Error making API request.

URL: GET http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/cubbyhole/my-app
Code: 403. Errors:

* permission denied
```

# Github

The GitHub auth backend can be used to authenticate with Vault using a GitHub 
personal access token. This method of authentication is most useful for humans: 
operators or developers using Vault directly via the CLI.

For this section you are required to have a [github account](https://www.github.com).

doc: [auth/github](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/github.html)

!SUB

Go to  [github.com/settings/organizations](https://github.com/settings/organizations) to create a new organization.

1. Fill in the name as **vault-meetup-$YOURNAME**. Replace $YOURNAME with your name. 
§Don't overthink the billing-email, what we are doing is completely free.
2. And create a team called "owners" at  https://github.com/orgs/vault-meetup-$YOURNAME/new-team 
with yourself in it.
3. Now generate a personal access token from Github with **read:org** access [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). 
Keep this token safe, its the credential you will use to authenticate.

!SUB

Now to configure vault.

Enable the github auth backend:
```
$ vault auth-enable github
Successfully enabled 'github' at 'github'!
```

Configure the organization in the auth backend.

```
$ vault write auth/github/config organization=vault-meetup-$YOURNAME
Success! Data written to: auth/github/config
```

Now we are making anyone in the "owners" team a root user in vault (not recommended).

```
$ vault write auth/github/map/teams/owners value=root
Success! Data written to: auth/github/map/teams/owners
```

!SUB

Try authenticating with Vault using our new github backend and your personal github token.

```
$ vault auth -method=github token=$GITHUBTOKEN
Successfully authenticated!
token: 26684a1f-f284-e863-c418-6ae2c507bd5a
token_duration: 0
token_policies: [root]
```

Success! Next experiment what happens when you remove yourself from the "owners" team. Or replace the root policy with the default policy.

Restart your Vault server to reset the authentication configuration.

!SUB
# SSH

You made it this far, try to challenge yourself by making the SSH secret backend work!

Follow the general documentation at: [secrets/ssh](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ssh/index.html)

The method to use with SSH is the OTP solution which requires the [vault-ssh-helper](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-ssh-helper)
